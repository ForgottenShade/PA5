Our lips meet as I inhale his scent. A surprisingly wonderful aroma of sweat
and herbs. His hand reaches to gently cup my face, pulling me into him. Our
mouths dance across each other, tasting and breathing. Finally we pull away a
moment and break into a wide and mischevious grin.

Placing his hand over mind, and with a short squeeze he says, "I'll be right back,
don't go anywhere." Leaving me holding his mask.

I promptly stand and as quickly and inconspicuously as possible exit the bar. I am
greeted by the rapid shift in color stepping back out into the rays of the now waning
vortex, purples replaced with hints of red. Slipping the mask into my cloak, I make my
way to the bridge and begin to cross it, glancing over my shoulder I spot someone dart
out of the bar behind me.

Weaving through the crowd I near the guards and pull the mask over my head. With a nod
they let me pass without even a second glance. Behind me I begin to hear shouts and I 
pick up the pace deeper into the district. After turning down several alleys the shouts
finally subside. I made it into the Ahjyl.
