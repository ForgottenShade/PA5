"Some might even call me too much to handle..."

"I might take you up on that challenge." He winks. I slowly remove the mask
from the table and stand. "You know, this is over yet. But I'll let you make
it interesting." He says, slowly lowering his arms.

"We'll see about that" I reply. Quickly I dive back into the crowd and make my way
out of the bar and towards the bridge. I am greeted by the rapid shift in color stepping
back out into the rays of the now waning vortex, purples replaced with hints of red.
Slipping the mask into my cloak, I dart to the bridge and begin to cross it, glancing
over my shoulder I spot someone step out of the bar behind me.

Weaving through the crowd I near the guards and pull the mask over my head. With a nod
they let me pass without even a second glance. Behind me I begin to hear shouts and I 
pick up the pace deeper into the district. After turning down several alleys the shouts
finally subside. I made it into the Ahjyl.
