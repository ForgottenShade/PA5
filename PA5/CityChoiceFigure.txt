Doubling back to the doorway where the myterios person emerged, I approach the
threshold. From within the sound of... laughter. Looking up at the name of the 
establishment, it reads "The Void Opal" in obsidian filigree on plain wood. The 
pungent smell of alcohol emenates from within.

Stepping inside, the scene is a veritable menagerie of races. Humans, elves, 
orcs, dwarves, all boisterously laughing and singing. The tune is unfamiliar, but
in the corner on a small stage stands a crook-backed goblin playing a lute. You only
catch the last few verses:
_
"And every dream, hope and desire
Is just a flicker in the fire
And that fire it will consume
The crack of doom
Is coming soon"

"The crack of doom is coming soon
The crack of doom is coming soon
The crack of doom is coming soon
The crack of doom is coming soon
The crack of doom is coming soon
The crack of doom is coming soon
The crack of doom is coming soon
The crack of doOoOom
DoOOoOOom
Is coming soon"
_
Upon the crescendo of which they all cheer, raising steins, and the goblin triumphantly lifts
the lute above his head and screeches, eyes wide and face painted in a toothy grin. He bows as
the crowd calms before declaring to all the world, "MY NAME IS LIL STINK," before running
into the kitchen prompting a loud crash and a string of cursing.

A sense of releif washes over me, the stress I had been holding all day as I walked the
city melting away. I could be just traveling, stumbling into a bar just like any other day.
And for a moment I allow myself to forget my reality.

After this spectacle the group returns to laughing and chatting. In the corner of the room you spot
your quary, a talland wiry armored form.A pitch black mask the texture of rotting wood seems to
stare back at you.
