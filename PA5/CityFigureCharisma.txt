"You're new here. In the Astral, I mean. I'm a trader of sorts, long distance travel,

you probably meant why does it look like this?" pointing at their face.

"Well one day, past the astral and into the chaos wastes on a trip to Sanzerathad, 
there was this great abberation. A huge worm like creature, mouth big enough for a

particularly explosive. So the big fuck face got all twisted and contorted from the
