+ CHOICE 5

Passing this doorway and entering the plaza I could see now the obstacle before me. A wall of solid Silver, intricately
carved in reflection of the city, the colors of the vortex refracting from its surface. The great river of energy
circumfrencing it wider than before. At the base of the wall, I could see now holes, this would likely be where
the energy flowed farther in. I considered my options.

1. Double back to the figure that crossed the street (Fight or Charisma)
2. Attempt to cross the river and enter via conduit (Constitution)
3. Sneak into a nearby building and attempt to find a disguise (Dexterity)
4. Spend time scounting the wall and learning the guard routines (Wisdom)
5. Watch for opportunities among the gates traffic (Intelligence)
