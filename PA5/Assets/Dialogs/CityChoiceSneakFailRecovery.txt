After dealing with the guard I drag the body into the window to avoid suspicion 
while I attmept to complete the shamble of a plan I have left. Luckily the home
seems vacant. I move from the kitchen to the base of the stairs and begin my 
ascent when I hear a noise to make me slow.

From here the floor wraps around the stairs to three doors. By the shape of the
house the two doors to my left would be against another building and I decide 
that these are less likely to be the bedroom and make my way to the third and
farthest door from the stairs. 

Just as I pass the first door I hear movement from inside as it immediately 
swings open behind me. I quickly move to stand behind the open door so as to
be obscured from view should they just be going downstairs. As luck would have
it they leave the door open, allowing me my hiding spot and within a moment I hear
the creak of the wooden stairs.

Swiftly striding the third door so as not to be caught I crack it open. I guessed
right! A sprawling bedroom with fine furniture, large mirrors, and red lace drapery 
over humungous bed stands empty before me. I softly close the door behind me as I go
and make for one of the large wardrobes at the far end of the room.

Within I find a series of fine dresses, robes, and tunics. I quickly grab an outfit
that seems roughly my size and make for the exit. Its at this moment I hear a commotion
from downstairs, it seems they discovered thier guest. Considering my options, I remember
a details I saw from the outside. Pulling back the curtains I reveal a balcony which I 
expediently swing open and drop from, holding my new digs.

I breifly scour the street and find a secluded spot to throw on the outfit. Once dressed 
to the nines I make my towards the bridge and strut confidently towards the Ahjyl. 

To my astonishment it somehow works and I find myself in the district without getting
so much as a second look. Pretending you belong seems to be consistent across planes
of existence.
