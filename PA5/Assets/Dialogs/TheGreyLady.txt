Having rested at a nearby street corner I have time to properly take in
my new environment as well as the hurdle that I overcame. The hexagonal
stone paving has given way long narrow strips of stone set around a
filliment of energy, color shifting and glowing. The houses are extravagent,
tall manor and estates fenced in with more curving roofs and intricate 
architecture. Tiers of pillars and mouldings provide an element of gravitas
to all of the houses, as if to remind you of their station. The housed themselves
have tiled stone and wood siding in varying geometric patterns while the windows
are all different shapes, and within those shapes, designs placed in colored 
glass. The doors are magnificent arches on grand pedestals set above the street.
Balconies overlook stone scuplture gardens and each house has a small wall around
it. I wonder at myself how will I manage to both find and make entry to my 
targets abode. It's precisely at this moment that I feel a bag thrown over
my head and my world goes dark.

I wake sometime later, how much I cannot tell. Abruptly light is returned to my
world and before me a great, cathedral of a hall. Long tables of ivory line a
marble hall. A dining room of exceptional scale with tall stained windows in 
long bays cornered with pillars stretching to the heavens. Runner of blue and
matching banners with a crest I do not recognize hand high in the rafters.

I sit strapped to a chair in the center of the room, made small by my surroundings.
A few meters of me stands a gorgeous woman, a long and generously cut silver dress
over a lithe figure. Her face aged, but like a fine wine, long black hair
curls to her mid back, golden eyes considering you.

She addresses you, her voice is hushed and considered, playfully
enjoying your predicament.

"You, my dear, seem to be a little lost."
