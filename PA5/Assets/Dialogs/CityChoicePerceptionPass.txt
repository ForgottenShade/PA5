Having created a mental timetable for the guards I begin to position
myself at the entrance of the bridge, ready to move swiftly over their
next shift change. Just as they begin to turn, seemingly on some 
hive-mind like clock to all do so at once, I make my move. I quickly,
but not so much as to draw undue attention make my way over the bridge
and before I know it I have slipped past the incoming sentries and 
stand in the Ahjyl, more than pleased with myself.
