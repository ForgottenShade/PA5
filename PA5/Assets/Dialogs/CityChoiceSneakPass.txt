Creeping through the window I drop silently onto the kitchen floor. Staying
low, I manuever my way to the base of the stares to get a view up. All seems
quiet in the house and I hear no movement from above. I slowly ease my way
upwards, careful not to make a sound until I reach the landing. 

From here the floor wraps around the stairs to three doors. By the shape of the
house the two doors to my left would be against another building and I decide 
that these are less likely to be the bedroom and make my way to the third and
farthest door from the stairs. 

Just as I pass the first door I hear movement from inside as it immediately 
swings open behind me. I quickly move to stand behind the open door so as to
be obscured from view should they just be going downstairs. As luck would have
it they leave the door open, allowing me my hiding spot and within a moment I hear
the creak of the wooden stairs.

Swiftly striding the third door so as not to be caught I crack it open. I guessed
right! A sprawling bedroom with fine furniture, large mirrors, and red lace drapery 
over humungous bed stands empty before me. I softly close the door behind me as I go
and make for one of the large wardrobes at the far end of the room.

Within I find a series of fine dresses, robes, and tunics. I quickly grab an outfit
that seems roughly my size and make for the exit. Tip-toeing past the open door and
down the stairs. I pass the kitchen where the silhouette of a man with blue skin stands
over a set of dishes. 

Gently opening the front door I make my way into the street and find a secluded spot to
throw on the outfit. Once dressed to the nines I make my towards the bridge and strut 
confidently towards the Ahjyl. 

To my astonishment it somehow works and I find myself in the district without getting
so much as a second look. Pretending you belong seems to be consistent across planes
of existence.
