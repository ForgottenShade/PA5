Out of the corner of my eye, another form emerges from a triangular archway set into a building, this one much
more human in appearance, though with a sickly yellow tinge, cat like irises, and knife-like ears. The masculine
figure meets my gaze as their eyes widen and they rush to my side, facing the assailant. From them a garevely voice
emits, their words ringing in my ears against the noise in my head.

"Relax they're mute, screaming in their mind won't do any good friend. I'm their charge, leave them with me." They
assert as they place a hand on the back of my neck, causing me to shudder. The noise ceases in my mind as it glances 
toward the speaker. I open my mouth to interject but they tighten the grip on the back of my neck as if to quiet me,
saying "Then if it's all the same with you, they need to return home."

And with that the creature releases me as the new hand forces me about and down the street. "Do not speak 
if you value your life," they hiss. "I will explain everything somewhere a bit more private. From now until
then, do as your told, and look at the ground."
