I slowly move towards the group, the elf lagging behind. I mozy up to
the back of the elf and drop my cloak so I seem a bit more haphazardly 
made up. As I follow the group to cross the bridge, trying my best to look
opressed and blend in, the guard decides to stop me specifically. Shit, it
didn't work. I make a break for the edge of the canal and leap into the 
energy below.

My body goes entirely numb, my vision black. I cannot move, I do not feel,
and slowly... I cease to exist.

You have died!
