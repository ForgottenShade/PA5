As they approach they reach forward and seem to point at me with a crooked finger. Within my mind a terrible
sound echos, that of scraping stone and screams. I turn and make to run the other direction but my foot catches
on an uneven tile and I fall, scraping my arms against the smooth stone. The noise continuous, varying tone and
frequency as I roll onto my back to face my presumable end. Now looming over me the creature reaches down and
grabs my shoulder, hoisting me to my feet and digging into my skin. Their eyes widen and the volume in my head
increases as they hold me in place.

1. Raise your hands and submit to the creature
