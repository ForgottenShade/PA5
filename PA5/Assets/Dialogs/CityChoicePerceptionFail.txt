Having created a mental timetable for the guards I begin to position
myself at the entrance of the bridge, ready to move swiftly over their
next shift change. Just as they begin to turn, seemingly on some 
hive-mind like clock to all do so at once, I make my move, but its too
early. The vision of all 6 of the guards, at the gate and tje wall all
locks on me in an instant. 

Before I can react I am pincushioned by archer fire and and blasted
back by some arcane force. My eyes slowly droop as my conciousness fades...

You have died!
