I make my way back along the canal until I reach a spot with both a view of the guards
on the top of the wall, as well as being hidden so that I might jump down into the
energy unnoticed.

To test my theory, I slowly lower my feet into the energy to see what kind of effect it
has. Immediately my feet begin to go numb and yank them out instinctively. The sense
of pins and needles is almost excruciating and I cling at them desperate for it to stop.
After a minute or two of this the feeling does eventually subside. 

This is going to be painful, but it seems there isn't much else in the way of options.
From my hidden place I watch the guards for some time and begin to pick up a pattern.
It seems theres a 20 second window every 20-30 minutes where the guards rotate to a 
new post. I wait until my moment before plunging myself in the energy.

The pain is immense and the canal deeper than I anticipated. My vision goes entirely
black as I am completely submurged in it. With no way up, what little survival instinct
seems to remain intact from that decision propels me forward towards entrance to the next
district.

My skin burns and I feel as though it begins to flake off under my clothes. I clench my 
eyes shut and steady myself against an invisible current pushing and pulling me. With my
hands outstretched I make my way across the river blind.
