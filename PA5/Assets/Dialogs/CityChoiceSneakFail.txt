As I slowly open the window I begin to climb inside. As I swing my legs
over into the frame, however, I fail to notice a cup and plate sitting
on a table adjacent and they crash to the ground loudly.

From outside I hear movement and before I can turn to look I am dragged 
back out the window and thrown onto the ground. It seems in my haste and
the reveal of my position, there was a guard just around the corner who heard
me. My only hope is to deal with him quickly before backup can arrive!
