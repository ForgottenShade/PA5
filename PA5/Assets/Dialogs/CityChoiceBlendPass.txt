I slowly move towards the group, the elf lagging behind. I raise my hood
and mozy up to the back of the elf where I place my hand on their back. They
give me a panicked look and I gesture for them to calm down. As luck would
have it, they go along with it. As the elf and I follow the group to cross
the bridge, I keep my eyes down and just look like I'm doing my job. It
works! They let me walk right past them and soon I am standing safe and
sound within the Ahjyl.
