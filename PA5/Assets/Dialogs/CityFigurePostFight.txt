The mercenary falls unconcious as I hear a commotion behind me. It seems during
the fight with them I started an all out brawl. Ducking from a flying bottle of
alcohol smashing next to my head I duck down over their body and attempt to
pry the mask off their face.

I promptly stand and as quickly and inconspicuously as possible exit the bar, ducking
blows and flying furniture as I go. I am greeted by the rapid shift in color stepping
back out into the rays of the now waning vortex, purples replaced with hints of red.
Slipping the mask into my cloak, I make my way to the bridge and begin to cross it,
glancing over my shoulder I spot someone dart out of the bar behind me.

Weaving through the crowd I near the guards and pull the mask over my head. With a nod
they let me pass without even a second glance. Behind me I begin to hear shouts and I 
pick up the pace deeper into the district. After turning down several alleys the shouts
finally subside. I made it into the Ahjyl.
