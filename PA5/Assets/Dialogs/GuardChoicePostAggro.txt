As the creature slumps against the ground, the noise inside my head finally begins to subside. As it does,
the sound warps to that of almost crying, a sharp pain and I understand its meaning. Flashes of memory come
over my eyes, a mother holding me, a vision of the city, a friend, and then it subsides. I stumble backwards
until my back is against the wall, the feeling of sorrow and loneliness lingering. 

Gulping down the misery, I look around once more for any more of them. It's at this time that, from a triangular
archway I didn't notice before, a figure emerges. This one much more human in appearance than the former, though
with a sickly yellow tinge to its skin, cat-like irises, and knife-like ears. It spots me imemdiately, eyes 
wide when it spies the body at my feet.

It strides up to me quickly as I fumble with my weapon. Grasping my wrist it stares me dead in the eyes, "You
will die here, come with me," it asserts, not so much a threat, but a fact and offer. Still taken aback from
the experience with the creature I relax against the grip on my wrist. They release me and grasp the back of
my neck. "This is to protect you, walk with me, do as you're told, don't look at anyone." Their voice gravely 
and grating.
