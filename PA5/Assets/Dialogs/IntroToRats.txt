Familiar, but not altogether what I remember of myself, I began to consider what just happened. This thought did not get too far as I was interrupted by a sound of a small screech and splash 
coming from farther down the tunnel. I grabbed the torch from the sconce off the wall and began down the tunnel towards the noise slowly. For some ways there seemed to be nothing, until a small 
lump appeared in the muck. It was grey and brown, vaguely furry though matted and hardened, and as I neared it I peered down at it. This proved to be a bad idea as it lunged at me.

You are fighting a rat!
