Having recovered from my wounds, I stand from the dry patch I found and get ready to continue. The only way out seems to be up. This passage is more filled than the rest, the
muck thicker than before and new horrible smells assault my nostrils. I must be getting close to something... Ahead another light glows. A chamber emerges from the dim, much larger
in size than previous. The smell here is a new echelon of terrible, breathing becomes a strenous activity of trying not to gag. Piles of the green-brown stuff stand almost as high as me.
Across the room, the goo seems almost sculpted. A throne of putrid magnificence for the king of the stink. And behind it, another set of tumescent yellow eyes stare hungrily.

You have found the king of the sewer, purveyor of filth, governor of the grime, and chief of putrescence, the almighty Stankrat!
