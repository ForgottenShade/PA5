Having defeated Stankrat you glance around his throneroom and glimpse a faint bit of light peeking around a
corner. Approaching the corner gaurdedly, ready for another fight you begin to notice the acrid smell of the 
rats and filth diminishing. Lunging around the corner, weapons drawn, you discover a hallway. At the end of 
this hallway the promise of light only seems to get brighter. Continuing warily you reach a set of stairs and 
begin to feel a gentle breeze which blows away much of the smell. Clamboring up the steps you reach a door. 
Set in its center, a window, empty space broken by iron bars. On the other side, blinding light.
Fumbling with the handle the door swings open as fresh air overtakes you for the first time.

You have escaped the sewer!
