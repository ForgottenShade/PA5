Writhing in pain, its maw stretched into a prolonged scream, the muck turns red with blood. Head pounding with adrenaline I step over the body and continue up the tunnel.
Reaching another intersection, the likely source of the goblin, I pause to catch my breath. After throwing up in the corner of the room, I propoerly survey the surroundings.
This room is much like the last intersection, though with only one exit to the chamber leading farther up. The chamber itself is somehow more disgusting than the last as
brown green slop oozes from almost everything, even dropping from the ceiling and landing on me at one point. By now the smell is no better, though I have mostly stopped noticing it.
The room itself has a some peices of rotten wood propped up in the corner with what looks like bits of old clothing drapped over it. This might have been the creatures home.

After that particularly morbid thought, it seems time to gather myself. Then I notice something out of the corner of my eye...
