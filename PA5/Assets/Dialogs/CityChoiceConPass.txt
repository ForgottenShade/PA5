It hurts but I push through the pain, my legs beginning to ache.
It feels as though my body is being drained of its very essence.
My senses diminish and just as all feeling starts to fade I feel
stone against my hand.

Relieved, I reach up to where I remember the conduit entrance being
but feel nothing. I start to panic as the sensory shutdown begins to creep
back in. I flail around wildly in the river as I feel my conciousness
slipping.

Just as I near the brink my hand catches on an edge. Mindlessly I haul
myself up and into whatever cavity exists and my head breaks the surface
of the energy. I find myself in a dim tunnel underneath the wall, barely 
big enough for me to crouch.

I crawl my way in and under the wall, body still partially submerged 
before clamboring up and out into an alleyway. It was painful, but I
made it into Ahjyl.

You take 5 points of damage!
