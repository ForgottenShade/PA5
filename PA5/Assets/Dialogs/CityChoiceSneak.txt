Resolving to find a disguise I venture through the neighboring alleyways,
trying to find a target. Eventually I spot it, a tall and elegant house of
3 stories. A pair of double windows flank a metal door, each place in an 
ornate sill of tiered stone. On window seems to have been left slightly ajar.

Creeping up to the window I peep inside, a fine kitchen with polished countertops
with an island table are placed around a fine, yet not that large, hearth.
Through a doorway I spot a staircase leading further into the house. I predict 
the bedrooms are probably on the second floor. Now just to get in.
