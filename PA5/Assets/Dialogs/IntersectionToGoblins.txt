In looking about further, there appeared to be some footprints in the thicker parts of the muck, three toed and misshapen. It seems there may be more then mere rats in these tunnels.
Several pairs of these feet all seemed to gather in the corner of the room, and under a particularly large pile of goo there almost seemed to be a form. In learning from the rats, I
stood a good few paces from it and threw a bit of the stone that had crumbled away at it. There was no reaction. Nearing what I determined to be a body, I saw a preview of what created
these footprints. It was small but lanky, only about half my height, with sickly colored green skin and pointed ears. Its body was capped with a bulbous head that would've had large
eyes had the rats not claimed them from the sockets of the corpse. This was definitely not good, and it was probably time to move on. I began my way up the sloping tunnel...

The air only seemed to thicken more as I continued and I had to stop myself from vommiting several times as the smell worsened. After a particularly loud step and having to stop myself from falling
face first into the grime, I stopped. A sound similar to the rats off in the distance. I steeled myself against whatever came around the bend and waited. And as I waited it grew louder, and closer,
and then louder still, this was either a really big rat, or a big problem. And before I could make up my mind to run, I saw it. Bulging yellow eyes reflecting against the light of the torch growing larger.
It's form emerging into the light, a hunched and twisted frame, large skull, it mashed its teeth and screeched at me.

You are fighting a goblin!
